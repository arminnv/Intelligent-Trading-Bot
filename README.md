# Intelligent Trading Bot
This repository contains code for my voluntary project "Intelligent Trading Bot" where I developed a fully automated trading bot by using various traditional algorithms and an attention-based convolutional auto-encoder
 and proximal policy optimization, integrated with Telegram as the user interface

## Repository Structure

- `auto_trader/`: Bot APIs, pipelines, strategies, and user interfaces
- `Trading_Agent/`: Training Deep Reiforcement Learning Bot using Proximal Policy Optimization
